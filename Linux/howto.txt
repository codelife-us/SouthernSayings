# If you do not have the GCC Compiler, you can install it with some commands:
# this was tested on WSL for Ubuntu 24.04

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install build-essential

# verify it is installed
gcc --version

# Download the southernsayings.cpp, perhaps to $HOME from this repository
g++ -std=c++20 southernsayings.cpp -o southernsayings

# you will then be able to execute the southernsayings file 
# example, if you are in the same current directory, then use ./southernsayings 
# use command line paramter or --help or -h to see the options available
